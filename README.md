# Temperature-Control
 Assingment for Mecatronic subject of IPB

The main idea is use a triac and a optocoupler to control the number of sinusoidal cycles over the Load, so we can control de RMS Voltage over the Load.

To complete de feedback loop, we can use a simple NTC sensor.

The following block diagram is used to model the system:
